# SSL certificates directory
# Place your SSL certificates here for HTTPS support:
# - server.crt (SSL certificate)
# - server.key (SSL private key)
#
# For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout server.key -out server.crt \
#   -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
